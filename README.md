# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICATION
This project predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical data. It is a simple and beginner-friendly machine learning project built using Python.  The dataset contains basic health information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, heart rate, and other related features. 
After preprocessing, a machine learning model is trained to classify patients as having heart disease or not. Common algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest are used for prediction. The model performance is evaluated using accuracy and other basic metrics.
Technologies Used:

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Project Steps:

Load and explore the dataset

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature selection

Model training

Model evaluation

Prediction on new data

This project helps beginners understand the complete machine learning workflow, from data loading to prediction. It is useful for students and learners who want to start with healthcare-based ML projects.
